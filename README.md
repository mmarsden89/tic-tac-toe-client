## Tic-Tac-Toe by Matt Marsden

For this project, we utilized technologies such as JavaScript, Bootstrap,
Jquery, HTML and CSS as well as github for version control.

Planning the project I created user stories to depict what I, as a user,
wanted from the experience as well as a basic wireframe to get a general
mapping of the different views I wanted the user to see.

### User Stories

As a player, I want to be able to easily create an account and log-in
As a player, I want to play against a computer or person so I'm not playing
against myself
As a player, I want an interface to keep track of my score so I know how well
I'm doing
As a player, I want an intuitive design so I don't need to read a document
to learn how to play

### Wireframe

### Future Iterations

The logic behind the game became more difficult as more features were
implemented. When I added the AI logic, it required me to rework how the code
was structured and utilized. In future iterations, I plan to spend some
major time overhauling and refactoring the code. As well, I plan to add
online play with a chat feature that pushes messages to the API
array interaction.
